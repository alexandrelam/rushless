# --- Hono Specific (Usually covered by General/Deno) ---
# Hono itself doesn't typically generate many ignore-worthy files.
# Add any project-specific build outputs, temporary files, or data directories here.
# Example:
# /public/uploads/ # If you have user uploads stored locally during dev
# session_data/    # If you store session files locally
